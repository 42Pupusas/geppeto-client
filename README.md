# Geppeto WebClient

Simple MVP to contact the Geppeto bot using a Nostr key. The site is built using the Yew Framework and hosted [here](https://geppeto.lat).

## Mission

Client can be adapted to contact more relays as new bots come online. Major improvements are needed on the payment UI/UX, as well as for the chat boxes.
